📈 DETAILED ANALYSIS:
**Flood Monitoring Report - [Date and Time]**

**1. 🎯 CURRENT SITUATION:**

Overall flood risk is currently **ELEVATED**.  While most monitoring zones show normal water levels, Zone B (Downtown) has reached critical levels, indicating a significant and immediate threat.  The system has recorded one critical alert in the past 24 hours.  Continued monitoring is crucial.


**2. 📍 ZONE ANALYSIS:**

* **🟢 Zone A - River Bridge:** Water levels are within the normal range (1.45m) and pose no immediate threat.  Sensor data from SENSOR_001 shows stable readings.

* **🔴 Zone B - Downtown:**  **CRITICAL FLOODING**. Water levels have reached the critical maximum (3.07m), indicating severe flooding. Immediate action is required in this area. Sensor data from SENSOR_002 requires urgent attention.

* **🟢 Zone C - Industrial Area:** Water levels are within the normal range (1.05m) and pose no immediate threat.  SENSOR_003 readings indicate stable conditions.


**3. 📊 TRENDS:**

Over the past 24 hours, a significant and rapid rise in water levels was observed in Zone B (Downtown), reaching the critical threshold.  This rapid increase suggests a potential dam break or exceptionally heavy rainfall in the upstream area.  Zones A and C have shown stable, normal water levels throughout the monitoring period.  The data from 48 database readings and 20 Google Sheets readings have contributed to this assessment.


**4. ⚠️ RECOMMENDATIONS:**

* **Authorities:**
    * Immediately deploy emergency response teams to Zone B (Downtown) for evacuation and rescue operations.
    * Assess the cause of the rapid water level increase in Zone B.
    * Implement traffic control and road closures in and around Zone B.
    * Prepare for potential downstream flooding based on the observed trend in Zone B.
    * Verify the accuracy and reliability of SENSOR_002.  The maximum level being the same as the current level may indicate sensor failure.
